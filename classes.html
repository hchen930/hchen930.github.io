                <h3>Creating A Class</h3>
                <p>A class in Java is a template that are used to create an object. It contains all the properties of an object such as its methods, fields, and data type. The structure shown below is an example of a class. <br> <strong>public class className { <br> private int fieldName; //this is a field <br> public className (parameters) {} //note that the constructor always shares the same name as the class name. <br> public int methodName() {} //This is a method<br>}</strong></p>
                <h3>Parts to a Method Signature</h3>
                <p> Here's a sample method: <br> <strong>public int getGrade(String name, int class){}</strong>
                </p>
                <ol> <li>First of all, we have to declare the access control of the method. The public keyword here makes the method accessible outside of this class. If we write private instead, this method will only be accessible inside class of this method.</li> <li> The next keyword is int. This is the type of value this method will return if it's called. If you don't want to return anything, write void. </li> <li>Next, we have the name of this method. Here, the method name is getGrade.</li> <li> Next, we have the set of parameter needed to call this method. We include the type of value and a temporary name that will be used inside this method only. If there's more than one parameter, separate them with commas. If there's no parameters needed, still include an empty set of empty parenthesis.</li></ol>
                <h3>The Main Method</h3>
                <p><strong>public static void main (String args[]) {}</strong> <br> In this main method that we have to write each time for the code to run, the main here means that this is where the entry point is when Java interprets your code.</p>
